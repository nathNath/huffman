# huffman

The purpose of this repo is to organize our DS project. It is a part of the evaluation of the DS course @ UFPB.

Problem: implement an encoder based on Huffman's Algorithm to text files. This encoder must have the following specs:
1. txt file as an input
2. calculate the probability of occurrence of each char in the txt
3. generate Huffman's tree
4. show Huffman encoding to each one of the txt chars

After implementing the encoder, use the same Huffman's tree to decode. This process consists on consulting Huffman's codes and going through Huffman's tree to discover which char is determined to a determined code.

Here's a SS of the project working properly:
